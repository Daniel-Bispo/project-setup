# Project Configuration

This repo aims to set up the structure of all my own projects. It is base on https://github.com/diego3g/node-microservices-ddd.

## Stack

- TypeScript
- Babel (for builds)
- Jest (for tests)
- ESLint (for coding standards)

## Usage

```node
git clone http://github.com/daniel-bispo/project-setup

yarn # installs all dependencies

yarn dev   # serves it for development
yarn test  # tests **/*.spec.ts files
yarn build # traspiles to JS and builds
yarn start # serves all dist folder's content
```
